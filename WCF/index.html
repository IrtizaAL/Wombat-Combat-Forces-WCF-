            <p class="light ">Boodja is a distant island where the territories of the 3 ancient clans of Wombats are located. The island has a huge glacier in its northwest area, this region is very cold so the Wombats try to live as far away as possible.
                <br>
                In the northern part of the island we can find the Uluru Mountains, territory of the <b class="text-white">Ülere,</b> a place of difficult access and large water reserves but where it is difficult to find fresh grass due to the amount of rock that forms its mountains. Due to the hardness of its fur and its powerful claws, they are the best standing hand-to-hand combat.
                <br>
                The Gibson desert is located in the south of Boodja, due to the progressive increase of temperatures in this region, water and vegetation rich areas are becoming increasingly scarce. This area is home to the Fai clan, specialists in creating very deep burrows, allowing them to hide from their opponents as a defensive technique.
                <br>
                In the east of the island, on the slopes of the Tibrogargan volcano, we can find the <b class="text-white">Aalan</b> clan, specialists in the construction of tunnel networks that allows them to travel long distances without being discovered.
                <br>
                There have been reports of encounters with <b class="text-white">a mysterious fourth group,</b> apparently insurgents who have abandoned their respective armies and are living in isolation in jungle areas, their numbers are unknown.
                <br>
                In the central area of the island, there are large areas of green pastures coveted by Wombats, the conquest of this region rich in many resources marked the beginning of a war between the clans. Who will take over the region?
                <br>
                Legend tells that the 3 clans of Wombats are descendants of the God Womeus (god of the volcano) and Wera (goddess of water) and that as a result of the collision between lava and ice, cube-shaped seeds emerged from which the first wombats were born. In honor of this event and to venerate their gods, Wombats make their feces in cubic form.
